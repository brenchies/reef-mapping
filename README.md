# reef-mapping

tensorflow based image analysis ai model for processing underwater photos of the sea floor in order to classify as reef, seagrass, or sand

To run the model you'll have to make sure you have Tensorflow and Keras set up as well as folders of images for training and classification with appropriate names. More details on that process are available on our Wiki page: http://wiki.brenchies.com/index.php?title=Reef_mapping_using_a_drone#Image_processing
